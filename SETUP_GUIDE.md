## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

1. **Check Gmail spam folder** - first submission might go to spam
2. **Verify the email address** in `google-apps-script.gs` line 21:
   ```javascript
   var recipient = "info@aptlyable.com";
   ```
3. **Check Google Apps Script logs**:
   - Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
   - Open your project
   - Click "Executions" on the left sidebar
   - Look for errors

### "Script not found" Error

- Make sure you deployed the script as "Anyone" can access
- Try creating a new deployment

### Authorization Issues

- Make sure you clicked "Allow" during authorization
- The script needs permission to send emails on your behalf

### Still Not Working?

1. Open browser developer console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Check that `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` is correctly set in `script.js`

## Email Limits

- **Free Gmail**: 100 emails per day
- **Google Workspace**: 1,500 emails per day

This should be more than enough for a learning assessment form!

## Making Changes

### Update Recipient Email

Edit `google-apps-script.gs` line 21:
```javascript
var recipient = "newemail@aptlyable.com";
```

Then deploy again (**Deploy** ‚Üí **New deployment**)

### Update Email Format

The `formatEmailBody()` function in `google-apps-script.gs` controls the email format. Edit it and deploy again.

### Testing Without Sending

Use the `testEmail()` function in Google Apps Script editor:
1. Select `testEmail` from the function dropdown
2. Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run button
3. Check the logs (View ‚Üí Logs)

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Safe**: The web app URL is public but only accepts form data
‚úÖ **Secure**: Only you can modify the script
‚úÖ **Private**: Form submissions go directly to your email
‚ùå **Don't share**: Your Google Apps Script URL in public repositories (though it's relatively safe)
